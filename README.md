# Taskify

A simple, clean **Todo application** built with **Express.js**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. Taskify provides a minimal, user-friendly interface to add, view, and manage todos. This repository contains both the frontend (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS) and a lightweight Express backend to serve files and provide a JSON-based API.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js

* **Storage (optional):** In-memory (default), file-based JSON, or any database you add

---

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (v12+ recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/22Arjun/taskify.git
cd taskify
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create an `.env` file if you want to set custom environment variables (optional).

---

## Running the app

### Development

Start the Express server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or if package.json uses "start" for development:
npm start
```

Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000` (port may vary depending on config)

### Production (build)

For a production deployment, ensure the server serves static files and you run with a production process manager (e.g. `pm2`) or behind a reverse proxy.

---

## API Endpoints

> These are example endpoints. The exact routing may vary depending on your implementation.

* `GET /api/todos` — Return JSON list of todos
* `POST /api/todos` — Create a new todo (expects JSON `{ "text": "Buy milk" }`)
* `PUT /api/todos/:id` — Update a todo (e.g. toggle complete)
* `DELETE /api/todos/:id` — Delete a todo

Example `curl` (creating a todo):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/todos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Walk the dog"}'
```

## Project Structure (suggested)

```
taskify/
├─ package.json
├─ server.js            # Express app entry
├─ public/              # Frontend static files
│  ├─ index.html
│  ├─ styles.css
│  └─ app.js
├─ data/                # optional file-based storage (todos.json)
└─ README.md
```

---

## Usage

* Open the app in your browser.
* Type a todo in the input field and click **Add Todo** or press Enter.
* Todos appear in the list. Use controls to mark complete or delete.

---

## Persisting Data

By default, a small starter project may use in-memory storage (loses data on restart). Consider one of these options for persistence:

* File-based JSON (`data/todos.json`) — simple and easy for prototypes
* SQLite or lowdb — lightweight embedded DBs
* MongoDB / PostgreSQL — for production-grade persistence

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Typical workflow:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m "feat: add ..."`)
4. Push and open a pull request

Be sure to keep commits small and descriptive.
